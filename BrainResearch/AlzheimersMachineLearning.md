* Data source for algorithm training: Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): [http://adni.loni.usc.edu]
* Paper: [https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/pdf/10.1148/radiol.2018180958]
* Training set: 1921 scans
* Evaluation sets:
	* 1st: 188 images from ADNI - 92% accuracy
	* 2nd: scans from 40 patients who presented to [https://memory.ucsf.edu] - 92% accuracy.
* Next steps: test and calibrate the algorithm on larger, more diverse datasets from different hospitals and countries
